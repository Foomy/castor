    <p>
        Were you ever in a store and thought: “Did I already have this flick in my DVD collection?”, or have
        you ever bought a new blu-ray only to realize at home you now own it twice? Well, it happened to me,
        and not only once. And that’s where Pollux comes in, my personal solution to my very personal
        problem: My weird brain.

        If you’re asking yourself now: “For Mike’s sake, who the heck has still books, blu-rays or even DVDs
        at home?” - Well, I guess this tool isn’t for you then. I build this primarily for me anyway. But
        maybe some people out there will like it and use it, I'd be delighted.
