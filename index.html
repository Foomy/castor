                    Were you ever in a store and thought: “Did I already have this flick in my DVD collection?”, or have
                    you ever bought a new blu-ray only to realize at home you now own it twice? Well, it happened to me,
                    and not only once. And that’s where Pollux comes in, my personal solution to my very personal
                    problem: My weird brain.

                    The main purpose of this is to help manage your medias like DVD, blu-ray or books.

                    If you’re asking yourself now: “For Mike’s sake, who the heck has still books, blu-rays or even DVDs
                    at home?” - Well I guess this tool isn’t for you. - I admit, I build this primarily for me, but if
                    some other dudes like and use it once it is finished, I’m glad.
